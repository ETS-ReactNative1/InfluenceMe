# InfluenceMe

### This application was completed as a part of my bachelor degree at TU Dublin.

# Project Scope

This tool was inspired by GOCOMO and I wanted to create a mobile influencer scouting application as a part of my thesis. 
This is relatively new on the market, therefore has a lot of potential to become an essential tool for smart and successful marketers.

The goal of the application is to automate the difficult and time-consuming influencer-scouting processes by allowing the user to discover and fetch profiles by a given hashtag and filter by profile follower count.

This is a powerful tool to easily identify and access profiles of instagram celebrities and makes it easy to identify a cluster of profiles that can be used to brand a client's product.

## Technologies

This is an iOS application build using React-Native. As well, several libraries were used in the creation of this tool:
 
 * Redux
 * React-Navigation
 * Firebase database
 * XCode
 
 To gain access to user profiles and fetch instagram information I used the Instagram GraphQL interface.
 
 ## Installation
 
 To install this tool on your device and run it, you must:
 
  * clone the respository to your desired location
 
  have the following technologies:
 
  * Homebrew
  * Node >= 8.3
  * Watchman
  * CocoaPods & XCode >= 9.4 / Expo Client
 
 Once the environment has been set up, the application can be built either using expo command line client or using XCode (command line - react-native run-ios)
 
 As this project had a time limit and was an indivirual piece of work, there are many things I would do differently if I were to do it again. But this is something to take into the interview ;)
